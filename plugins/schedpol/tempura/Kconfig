  The policy sets an upper bound of CPU quota, given a temperature constraint
  (maximum CPU temperature allowed) and optionally and energy budget constraint.
  The latter is derived from the need of guaranteeing that, while battery-powered,
  the system will stay on for a target amount of time.

  The CPU upper bound then is partitioned among the active applications in a way
  proportional to the priority level.
