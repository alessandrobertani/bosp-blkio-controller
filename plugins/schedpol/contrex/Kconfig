  This policy is for mixed-criticaly embedded systems, featuring
  a multi-core CPU.
  The policy labels the prio=0 applications has 'critical', while all the
  other priority levels are considered 'non-critical'.
  The available CPU quota is distributed among the applications reserving
  for each critical one 1 core (100% quota) at most. The remaining quota
  is then evenly distributed among non-critical applications.
