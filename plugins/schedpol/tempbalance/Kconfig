  This simple policy assigns an amount of CPU quota / number of CPU cores to
  the active applications which is proportional to the application priority level.
  This means that priority 0 applications will receive a CPU partition bigger
  than application featuring lower priority values.
  If the CPU Power Management support has been enabled, the policy will also consider
  the temperature of the cores, in order to perform a mapping that could balance
  the thermal profile.
