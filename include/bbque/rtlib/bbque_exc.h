	 * @brief Build a new EXC
	 *
	 * A new EXecution Context could be build by specifying a <i>name</i>,
	 * which identifies it within the system and it is used mostly for
	 * logging statements, and a <i>recipe</i>, which specifies the set of AWM
	 * supported by the specific stream processing application being
	 * defined.
	 *
	 * The creation of a new EXC requires also a valid handler to the RTLib, which
	 * will be used for the (application transparent) communication with the
	 * BarbequeRTRM. Thus, an application willing to instantiate an EXC should
	 * foremost initialize the RTLib, which could be done as explained in @ref
	 * rtlib_sec03_plain.
	 *
	 * This is an example snippet showing how to properly instantiate an EXC:
	 * \code
	 *
	 * #include <bbque/bbque_exc.h>
	 *
	 * class ExampleEXC : public BbqueEXC {
	 * // definition of the application specific EXC
	 * };
	 *
	 * // The EXC handler
	 * pBbqueEXC_t pexc;
	 * pexc = pBbqueEXC_t(new ExampleEXC("YourExcName", "YourRecipeName", rtlib));
	 *
	 * // Checking registration was successful
	 * if (!pexc || !pexc->isRegistered()) {
	 * 	fprintf(stderr, "EXC registration FAILED\n");
	 * 	return EXIT_FAILURE;
	 * }
	 *
	 * \endcode
	 *
	 * @note To properly exploit the RTLib provided instrumentation for the
	 * profiling of run-time behaviors of the EXC, the application integrator
	 * should avoid to get resources, such as spawning threads (e.g. setup a
	 * thread pool), from within the EXC constructor.
	 * This method should be used just to pass the EXC a set of configuration
	 * parameters to be saved locally to the derived class, while the actual
	 * initialization code should be placed into the \ref onSetup method, which
	 * indeed it is called by the base class right after the constructor.
	 *

	 * subset of all the possible working modes defined by the associated recipe,
	 * which represents the only acceptable AWM assignment for the application.
	 *
	 * A set of constraints could be defined with a single call of this method.
	 * Each constraint:
	 * <ul><li>
	 * refers to a specific <i>AWM ID</i>
	 * </li><li>
	 * could be of type: <i>upper bound</i>, <i>lower bound</i> or
	 * <i>exact value</i>
	 * </li><li>
	 * could be <i>added</i> or <i>removed</i>
	 * </li></ul>
	 * By mixing addition of new constraints and removal of previously defined
	 * ones, it is possible to completely customize the set of overall recipe
	 * defined AWMs to shape a custom set of valid AWMs.
	 * Examples:
	 * <ul><li>
	 * <code>[2, UpperBound, Add]</code>: add an upper bound on the set of valid AWM, all the
	 * AWM with ID > 2 will be disabled
	 * </li><li>
	 * <code>[4, ExactValue, Add]</code>: add an exact value on the set of valid
	 * AWM, AWM with ID 4 is considered enabled
	 * </li></ul>
	 * Thus, at the end of such a configuration, all AWMs but

	 * @note
	 * A call to this method is granted to be <i>atomic</i> at the BarbeqeRTRM
	 * side, which means that all the specified constraints actions are processed

	 * management of the whole system.

	 * RTLIB_EXC_WORKLOAD_NONE to actually terminate the processing cycle. In this

	 * while it is executing this method. However, in case the latency introduced
	 * by a single call of this method should not be compliant with the run-time
	 * management goals (e.g. scheduling a just started high-priority application)
	 * the RTRM has the capability to force a termination of this method, i.e.
	 * eventually also by kill a "not responding" application.

	 * method should be better placed into the \ref onMonitor call-back.
